* Webcam Poller
A bunch of stuff that polls the [[https://webcams.nyctmc.org/multiview2.php][NYC Department of Transportation]] cameras once per second, and generates a seekable livestream from it.
* Why?
The NYC DOT traffic cameras are useful, but you can't seek backwards in time, making it difficult to see previous frames unless you've saved it.

This repo contains a Docker image that glues together:
- Go daemon that polls for images
- ffmpeg RTSP stream
- ffmpeg stream to m3u8's
- nginx HLS server
- absurdly barebones website that let's you pick the camera(s)

* Usage
who knows lol

* Missing Features
  - Database
  - Search
  - Long term archival to blob storage
  - Everything beyond the barebones



* Demo
TBD
* License
See LICENSE file.
* Design Choices
* Files & Details

  - ~/site~ contains the html site to serve
